# Auction Site
 

## Description
A full stack React / Node app letting users place bids on items. Once the site Admin has logged in and closed a bid, the user's UI updates in real time to display the result.
The point of the App at the moment is to implement a functional back-end rather than building a beautiful and responsive UI.

## Setup/Installation
To view the app, click https://auction-site-front.herokuapp.com/

Please log in using these details: 

- username: User1
- password: IamUserOne

- username: User2
- password: IamUserTwo 

- username: Admin
- password: IamTheBoss 


## How to use
Open two tabs/windows, log in using the users credentials above and submit bids
Log in as the Admin (on a different tab/window) and close any of the bids
The back end will calculate the winner for the bid(s) you closed and the user's UI will update in real time
Reset the bids from the Admin's page
