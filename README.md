# Auction Site
 

## Description
A React / Node app letting users place bids on items. Once the site Admin has logged in and closed a bid, the user's UI updates in real time to display the result.
The point of the App at the moment is to implement a functional back-end rather than building a beautiful and responsive UI.

## Setup/Installation
To view the app, click https://auction-site-front.herokuapp.com/

Please log in using these details: 

username: User1<br />
password: IamUserOne

username: User2<br />
password: IamUserTwo 

username: Admin<br />
password: IamTheBoss 


## How to use
Open two tabs/windows, log in using the users credentials above and submit bids.<br />
Log in as the Admin (on a different tab/window) and close any of the bids.<br />
The back end will calculate the winner for the bid(s) you closed and the user's UI will update in real time.<br />
Reset the bids from the Admin's page. 


## Improving the App
At the moment, if a user refreshes the page the bid result message disappears and the user can keep biding. <br />
I will re-implement the option to update the bid status on the back end to fix this.
